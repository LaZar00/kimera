> A rejuvenation effort on the original kimera tool built by Borde for Final Fantasy 7 model viewing.

The original Kimera tool was build by Borde for viewing Final Fantasy VII models and has been left untouched for the last few years. This has left some feature requests left to be addressed and some enhancements that could be added to improve the experience. Ultimately the hope is to rebuild the tool in a modern langangue and framework but this project will be used to track updates and fixes to the original VB6 version. 

For more information on the Kimera tool itself, please view the forum post here:

## Usage 
To use this tool, please download the standalone package which should run as an executable. This will allow you to use models extracted from Final Fantasy VII. To extract these models from the steam or square enix versions of the games, you can follow some [instructions here](http://mirex.mypage.sk/FILES/gamedata.txt) or reach out to the community in [Qhimm](http://forums.qhimm.com/index.php) who may have resources to help.

## Contributing
If you are interested in contributing to the project, you will need to use the Visual Basic 6 IDE which can be found here: [Torrent & Zip links](https://archive.org/details/VS6enCDs)
You will also need the newer OpenGL definitions for VB6 and glExtensions. You can download them from [this page](http://www.pauldahuach.com.ar/program_en.htm)
If you are installing this on a new enough OS, I recommend checking for potential issues first, I had to follow the following guide to get it working for me: [Second comment in the post](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/52001443/cannot-install-vb6-ide-on-windows-10)

Please feel free to reach out if there are issues. 

Cheers
